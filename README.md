# B2B eCommerce Microservices Platform

## Overview

This B2B eCommerce platform is a comprehensive solution built using a microservices architecture. It enables businesses to create and manage their online presence, product catalogs, and customer relationships. The platform is designed with scalability, resilience, and maintainability in mind, making it suitable for businesses of all sizes.

## Architecture

### System Architecture

The platform follows a microservices architecture pattern, with each service responsible for a specific business domain. This approach allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of individual components.

### Key Components

1. **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate microservices
2. **Service Discovery**: Manages service registration and discovery
3. **Microservices**: Independent services for specific business domains
4. **Message Broker**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between services
5. **Databases**: Each service has its own database
6. **Authentication/Authorization**: Centralized identity management

### Communication Patterns

1. **Synchronous Communication**: REST APIs for direct service-to-service communication
2. **Asynchronous Communication**: Event-driven architecture using RabbitMQ
3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures across services

- **Retry Mechanisms**: Handles transient failures

## Benefits

### For Businesses
- **Scalability**: Easily scale individual services based on demand
- **Flexibility**: Adapt to changing business requirements
- **Resilience**: Fault isolation prevents system-wide failures
- **Time-to-Market**: Independent development and deployment of services

### For Developers
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use the most appropriate technology
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused codebases are easier to understand and maintain
- **Testability**: Services can be tested in isolation
- **Deployment**: Independent deployment reduces risk and enables continuous delivery

### For Operations
- **Resource Efficiency**: Scale services based on their specific resource needs
- **Monitoring**: Granular monitoring of individual services
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one service don't affect others
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Deploy updates to specific services without affecting others

## Development Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MongoDB
- RabbitMQ

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/b2b-ecommerce-platform.git
   cd b2b-ecommerce-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for all services**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies for each service
   cd tenant && npm install
   cd ../customer && npm install
   cd ../products && npm install
   cd ../shopping && npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in each service directory
   - Update the variables with your local configuration

4. **Start the services using Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

5. **Access the services**
   - Tenant Service: http://localhost:8004
   - Customer Service: http://localhost:8001
   - Products Service: http://localhost:8002
   - Shopping Service: http://localhost:8003

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make changes to the relevant service**

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   cd service-name && npm test
   ```

4. **Submit a pull request**

### Adding a New Microservice

1. **Create a new directory for your service**
   ```bash
   mkdir new-service && cd new-service
   ```

2. **Initialize a new Node.js project**
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

3. **Install core dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install express mongoose amqplib winston jsonwebtoken
   ```

4. **Copy the basic structure from an existing service**
   - Adapt the code to your service's needs
   - Follow the established patterns for consistency

5. **Add your service to docker-compose.yml**

6. **Create comprehensive documentation in README.md**

## Deployment Guide

### Docker Deployment

1. **Build the Docker images**
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Run the services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Kubernetes Deployment

1. **Create Kubernetes deployment files**
   - Use the provided templates in the `k8s` directory

   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

### Cloud Deployment

The platform can be deployed to various cloud providers:

- **AWS**: Using ECS, EKS, or EC2
- **Azure**: Using AKS or App Service
- **Google Cloud**: Using GKE or Compute Engine

Detailed deployment guides for each cloud provider are available in the `docs/deployment` directory.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks

Each service provides a `/health` endpoint that returns the service's health status, including:
- Service status
- Database connectivity
- Message broker connectivity

### Logging

- Structured logs are stored in the `logs` directory of each service
- In production, logs should be aggregated using a centralized logging system (ELK Stack)

### Monitoring

- Prometheus metrics are exposed on the `/metrics` endpoint of each service
- Grafana dashboards are provided in the `monitoring` directory

## Extending the Platform

### Adding New Features to Existing Services

1. Identify the appropriate service for your feature
2. Follow the service's README.md for guidance on adding new endpoints
3. Implement the necessary repository methods, service logic, and API endpoints
4. Add appropriate tests
5. Update documentation

### Creating New Events

1. Define the event structure and payload
2. Implement the event publisher in the source service
3. Implement the event subscriber in the target service(s)
4. Test the event flow end-to-end

### Integrating with External Systems

1. Create a dedicated integration service or add integration capabilities to an existing service
2. Use the circuit breaker pattern for external API calls
3. Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
4. Add appropriate logging and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service Unavailable**
   - Check if the service is running
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check the service's health endpoint

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify MongoDB connection string
   - Check MongoDB logs
   - Ensure the database server is running

3. **Message Broker Issues**
